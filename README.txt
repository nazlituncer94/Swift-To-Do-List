Swift To Do List Application 
Nazli Tuncer (nt2320)

This repository contains all the code written for the native To Do List application built.

HOW TO RUN APP: 
Pre-requisites - Install the latest version of XCode from the Mac App Store to be able to run the app. XCode comes with an iOS simulator. 

1) Download (or fork/clone) GitHub repo. 
2) Open the folder "To Do List" in Xcode. 
3) Click the “Run” button on the upper left corner. This will first build your application and then initiate the iOS simulator so you can view the app. 

Notes: 
* There is no “main file/function” in Swift’s code design so you can run without having to select a specific file within the To Do List folder. 
* You can change which iOS device is shown on the simulator by clicking drop-down menu to the right of “Run” button (e.g. iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, etc.) 
* The first time the simulator is run it will take a substantial time to load. Please allow ~ 15 minutes. 

3) The “To Do List” application is running. Add reminders and delete completed tasks to see the app at work. 

UNDERSTANDING CODE STRUCTURE: 
* FirstViewController.swift = Code for first tab (“To Do List”)
* SecondViewController.swift = Code for second tab (“Add More”)
* Main.storyboard = Visual layout of application. Provides conceptual overview of app.

For further explanation and screenshots of the working app please see my final report. 

TUTORIALS USED: 
“The Swift Guy”s tutorials were used as guidance while building this app (reference -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrCqXmHenJY). For additional tutorials used, please see my final report.
